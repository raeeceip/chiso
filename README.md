This project aims to create a personalized AI model using your own data. It includes Go code for data collection, preprocessing, and setting up a basic neural network.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build an AI model that can mimic your writing style, opinions, and knowledge based on your personal data. This is achieved through the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering text data from various sources like journals, blog posts, and social media.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the collected data.
3. Model Setup: Creating a basic neural network structure for language modeling.
4. Training: Fine-tuning the model on your personal data.
5. Evaluation and Improvement: Testing the model's performance and iteratively improving it.

## Files

- `main.go`: The main entry point of the application.
- `data_collection.go`: Contains functions for collecting text data from files.
- `data_preprocessing.go`: Includes text preprocessing functions.
- `neural_network.go`: Sets up a basic neural network using the Gorgonia library.

## Usage

1. Place your personal text data in the `personal_data/` directory.
2. Run the main application:
